# LLM Extension

Simple example of using openai's API via a chrome browser extension... 

What does it do you ask?

If you select text, right click on the page, select the option you want... it will send it to the openai api and open the result on a new tab.

You can hack the prompts, add more... less whatever... if you do anything cool, let me know.

Yes there are bugs...
yes my code sucks... I am not a JS dev

If it breaks, you can keep the pieces.
